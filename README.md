# Vanila_GAN_Implementation
Vanilla GAN implantation from Scratch:

1) The generator and discriminator are simply chosen as a MLP. The generator and discriminator network are defined in model.py

2) Training is done in train.py. Change the hyperparameter (e.g., learning rate, batch size, epoch, optimizer) in train.py file. Train with larger epoch in you want to get better results.

Some results on Benchmark MNIST for sanity check:
