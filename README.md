# Vanila_GAN_Implementation
Vanilla GAN implantation from Scratch:

The generator and discriminator are simply chosen as MLP. The generator and discriminator network are defined in model.py

Training is done in train.py. Change the hyperparameter (learning rate, batch size, optimizer) in train.py file as you wish.
