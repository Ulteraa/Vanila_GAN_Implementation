# Vanila_GAN_Implementation
Here, we implenet the Vanila GAN from Sctrach. 
The generator and discrimnator sare simply a MLP.
In model.py, we have the generator and discrimnator network and in train.py file,  we have the training file. You can simply change the hyperparameter (learning rate,
batch size, optimizer) in this file.
