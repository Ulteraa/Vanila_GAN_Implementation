# Vanila_GAN_Implementation
Vanilla GAN implantation from Scratch:

1) The generator and discriminator are simply chosen as a MLP. The generator and discriminator network are defined in model.py

2) Training is done in train.py. Change the hyperparameter (learning rate, batch size, optimizer) in train.py file as you wish.
